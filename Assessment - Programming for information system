Company Name: GID Renovation
Description: GID Renovation is a medium-sized construction and home remodeling company with approximately 75 employees specializing in residential and small commercial renovation projects. The company offers services including kitchen and bathroom remodels, home additions, basement finishing, and complete home renovations. GID Renovation manages multiple concurrent projects across different locations, coordinating contractors, ordering materials, scheduling inspections, and maintaining client communications. Currently, their project management and information tracking relies primarily on spreadsheets, email chains, and paper documentation, leading to inefficiencies, communication gaps, and difficulty tracking project statuses in real-time.
