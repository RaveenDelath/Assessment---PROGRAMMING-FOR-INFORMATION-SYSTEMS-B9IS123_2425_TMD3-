# Details About Assignment 
## 1. Technical Architecture Highlights

* REST API endpoints - Comprehensive documentation with JSON examples
* JSON data exchange - Emphasized throughout the API documentation
* SQLAlchemy database implementation - Highlighted in architecture and models
* Role-based access control - Detailed permissions system
* File upload capabilities - Complete API endpoints and security features

## 2. Frontend Technology Stack

* Vanilla JavaScript - Explicitly specified "Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)"
* Pure JavaScript approach - No external JS frameworks, emphasizing vanilla JS

## 3. Backend Technology Stack

* Python as main language - Clearly stated throughout
* Flask framework - Highlighted as the core web framework

## 4. Enhanced Sections:
### System Architecture

Detailed technical architecture diagram
Complete separation of frontend-backend
JSON communication flow
SQLAlchemy ORM integration

### REST API Documentation

Complete CRUD operations for all entities
JSON request/response examples
Authentication with JWT tokens
File upload API endpoints
Proper HTTP status codes

### Project Structure

Detailed vanilla JavaScript file organization
SQLAlchemy model structure
Flask route organization
File upload handling

### Security Features

Enhanced file upload security
JWT authentication
Role-based access control
Comprehensive validation

This README now perfectly aligns with your technical requirements and will demonstrate to your lecturer that you understand:

API-first architecture with complete frontend-backend separation
Pure vanilla JavaScript for all client-side interactions
Python/Flask backend with SQLAlchemy ORM
Comprehensive CRUD operations with JSON communication
Professional file upload system with security considerations

## Key Points
### 1. Assignment Compliance
* API-Frist Architecture: Frontend makes API calls, no post-and-refresh.
* JavaScript Required: Using Vanilla JavaScript for all Frontend interactions.
* CRUD Heavy Focus: Implementing full CRUD for Projects and Clients.(First of all try to finish one CRUD Operation for Projects).
* External Integrations: Google Maps API for Project Locations.
* Testing Strategy: Unit tests for CRUD + Integration Test for Frontend-Backend.

### 2. Why GID Revovation is Perfect
* Complex enough to demostrate advanced programming skills.
* Real business problem that justifies  comprehensive system.
* Multiple user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Contractor, Client)
* Rich data relationship perfect for database design.
* Clear API integration oppatunities.

### 3. Technical Architecture Highlights. 
* REST API endpoints for all operations.
* JSON data exchange between frontend and backend.
* Database implementation with SQLAlchemy.
* Role-based access control for different user types.
* File upload capabilities for project documentation.

## Why costruction industry?
Complex data relationships, Real business pain points (), Multiple user types.

## Prepared sample RESTful Structure for CRUD Operations.
### Projects:
-> List All Projects (With Filtering | Pagination)
-> Get Specific Project Details 
-> Create New Project
-> Update Entire Project
-> Partial Project updates
-> Delete Project 

### Clients:
-> List Clients
-> Get Client Details
-> Create New Client 
-> Update Client
-> Delete Client

### Additional considerations for GID Renovation:
-> Project Timeline
-> Upload Progress Photos
-> Cost Estimates
-> Update Project Status

* With these three CRUD Operations, first of all I'm going to focus on projects.
* When it comes to the connection between the REST API and Flask,
  REST API = The "what" and "how" (The Design Principles)
  Flask =  The "with what" (The Tool to Implement It)
